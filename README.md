# Indian Proxy [Updated in JSON]

### Indian Proxies from various sources updated every 15 minutes!

#### Currently Proxies are scraped from:
  - Fate0
  - PubProxy
  - SpyProxy
  - GatherProxy
  - GetProxyList
  - ProxyScrape
  - Free-Proxy-List

#### First of all install all the requirements:

```
$ sudo -H pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### To Update the proxy yourself just run this command:

```
$ python3 script.py
```

#### TODO:
 - ~~Setup Automatic Update of proxies using Raspberry Pi~~ (Automated and Deployed on Heroku instead of Pi)

### Credits

This work wouldn't have been possible without
